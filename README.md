DESCRIPTION:

Key Takeaways:

Decision Tree Model Training: Utilized a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer purchases based on demographic and behavioral data.

Data Preparation: Ensure dataset readiness by defining features and converting categorical variables.

Data Splitting: Divide dataset into training and testing sets for accurate model assessment.

Model Training: Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data to predict customer purchases.

Model Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and performance using the classification report, which reveals precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Visualization: Visualizing the decision tree aids in understanding influential features guiding customer purchase decisions.

Actionable Insights: These insights inform the creation of targeted marketing strategies aligned with customer behavior patterns.
